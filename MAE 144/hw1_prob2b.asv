%2b.  Is the controller determined in 1a proper?  If not, change your target f(s) by adding 
% k additional poles to T(s) at, say, s=-20, for a sufficiently large k such that the answer 
% returned by RR_Diophantine is proper, compute the modified D(s), and check that it worked.  
% (How big does k need to be?). Discuss.
